>
> 1. [Fork this repository](https://github.com/Mark02-2012/YTPlusM/fork) using this link or the fork button on the top right (If you already have YTLite or similar fork that prevents you from forking my MaxTube, you should delete that fork to be able to fork my repository).

## What Means MaxTube and YTPlusM DIY
<details>
 <summary><strong>MaxTube</strong></summary>
<p><strong>MaxTube</strong> is my fork of <a href="https://github.com/dayanch96/YTLite">YTPlus/YTLite</a> that has <strong>eleven more tweaks integrated</strong> (<a href="https://github.com/fosterbarnes/YTweaks">YTweaks</a>, <a href="https://github.com/castdrian/Gonerino">Gonerino</a>, <a href="https://github.com/PoomSmart/YouSpeed">YouSpeed</a>, <a href="https://github.com/arichornlover/YTLowContrastMode">YTLowContrastMode</a>, <a href="https://github.com/VasirakCalgux/VolumeBoostYT">VolumeBoostYT</a>, <a href="https://github.com/PoomSmart/YouGetCaption">YouGetCaption</a>, my tweak <a href="https://github.com/Mark02-2012/YTPlaybackFix">YTPlaybackFix</a>, <a href="https://github.com/PoomSmart/YouChooseQuality">YouChooseQuality</a>, <a href="https://github.com/Tonwalter888/YouShare">YouShare</a>, <a href="https://github.com/bhackel/YouLoop">YouLoop</a> and <a href="https://github.com/PoomSmart/YouMute">YouMute</a>) + YTPlus/YTLite without subscription required. <strong>YTPlus releases will not have those extra tweaks, but only YTPlus/YTLite YouPiP, YTUHD, Return-YouTube-Dislikes, YouQuality, DontEatMyContent and YTABConfig.</strong>

<strong>But why the old name was "YTPlusM"?</strong>
Well, the original project is named <a href="https://github.com/dayanch96/YTLite">YTPlus</a>, so since my fork provides more advantages, I wanted to add an "M" to indicate that it's YTPlus, but improved by me, Mark02.

<p><strong>Old secondary repository for building YTPlusM (now MaxTube) IPAs with GitHub Actions (deleted);
<li><strong>Read more <a href="#must-read">here</a></strong></li></p>
</details>

## MaxTube versions changelog
<li><strong>1.0 (April 14 2026):</strong></li>
First release, added YTweaks, Gonerino and YouSpeed injectable
<li><strong>1.1 (May 5 2026):</strong></li>
Finally! YTLowContrastMode added, supporting also newest YT IPAs
<li><strong>1.2 (May 11 2026):</strong></li>
Added VolumeBoostYT and YouGetCaption
<li><strong>1.3 (June 24 2026):</strong></li>
Created by myself and added YTPlaybackFix
<li><strong>1.4 (July 12 2026):</strong></li>
Added YouChooseQuality, YouShare and PleaseDontStopTheMusic + replaced YTLowContrastMode with my new fork of it where I added a setting section
<li><strong>1.4.2 (July 17 2026):</strong></li>
Updated YouTube Plus from 5.2.1 to 5.2.2; cracked by <a href="https://www.reddit.com/u/shinewake/s/ZeFbBOkUAa">zarzel</a> and compiled the .deb by myself
<li><strong>1.5 (August 24 2026):</strong></li>
• Changed name from YTPlusM to MaxTube


• Fixed YTLowContrastMode setting section not showing in 20.x versions.

• Added YouLoop and YouMute (in Video Overlay settings).

• Replaced Gonerino by castdrian with the fork YGonerino by fosterbarnes.

• Updated my tweak YTPlaybackFix. It is now a combination of my method (refreshing the video player when it detects the error; fixed the loop issue, incompatibility with 20.x versions of YouTube, added support for error code 0, and incompatibility with RootHide Patcher) and the method by @AppropriateNet_2928 named YouFixPlaybackIssues (spoof client and experimental PoToken bypass). Includes a setting section to enable/disable each method. Both are enabled by default.
<li><strong>1.5.3 (August 30 2026):</strong></li>
Replaced VolumeBoostYT by irum0320 with the fork by candyzp
<li><strong>1.5.4 (September 1 2026):</strong></li>
Returned to the original VolumeBoostYT tweak because the fork used in MaxTube 1.5.3 was buggy.
<li><strong>1.6 (September 12 2026):</strong></li>
• Updated YTPlaybackFix (specifically Spoof Client method, now spoofs to TV Simply client as Android VR is now broken and has buffers)


• Using again the fork of VolumeBoostYT by candyzp because he fixed a lot of issues

• Removed PleaseDontStopTheMusic because it caused issues with calls and audio

<li><strong>1.6.2 (September 14 2026):</strong></li>
• Fixed Gonerino lag issue in playlists

<li><strong>1.7 (September 26 2026):</strong></li>
• Updated YTPlus to version 6.0b1

• My tweak YTPlaybackFix will not be in my prebulit IPAs anymore, as YTPlus now has its own and seems better, and also Gonerino will not be anymore in my pre-compiled IPAs, because it caused issues, but if you want them you can build an IPA by yourself with them with GitHub Actions
